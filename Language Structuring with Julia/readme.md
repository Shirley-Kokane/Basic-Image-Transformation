We will look at another very important data source: written text in natural language. (The word "natural" here is to distinguish human (natural) languages from computer languages.)

We will both analyse actual text and try to generate random text that looks like natural language. Both the analysis and synthesis of natural language are key components of artificial intelligence and are the subject of much current research.
